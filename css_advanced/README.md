# CSS Advanced — ALX Project

**Directory:** `css_advanced`  
**Repo:** `alx_html_css` (GitHub)

## Project overview
This repository contains the advanced HTML/CSS exercise focused on styling a page to match a Figma design. You'll find an `index.html` scaffold and a starter `css/styles.css` that you should expand to match the Figma design exactly (spacing, colors, fonts).

## Figma design & assets
- **Figma file:** (paste your Figma URL here — duplicate to Drafts)
- **Images & icons:** Place exported images in `assets/images/`
- **Fonts:** Place downloaded fonts in `fonts/`  
  - `Source Sans Pro` (Google Fonts)  
  - `Spin-Cycle-OT` (download from the Figma assets or assignment)

## How to run locally (Windows)
Open PowerShell, then:
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\alx_html_css
git checkout main
cd css_advanced
# Start a simple static server (optional, recommended)
py -3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
